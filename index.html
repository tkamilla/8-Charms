              <p>Sadness is sometimes a feeling that we are not where we want to be emotionally. With a little bit of time and breathing, we can take a look at this sad moment and learn where we are. How we got where we are now. And how can we get to where we want to go. But with smile and strong heart, our sadness will push us to the bright happiness we dream of, it will!</p>

And as always, I will be with you in heart to walk with you.</p>
